> release-analysis comment.
>
> This surface catalog and its maturity labels are derived from the live
> [OpenClaw maturity scorecard]({{SCORECARD_URL}}) and
> [maturity taxonomy]({{TAXONOMY_URL}}). Priority reflects this release's change
> volume, change size, impact scope, upgrade risk, and maturity expectations.
>
> **Score bands:** Experimental 0–50%; Alpha 50–70%; Beta 70–80%; Stable
> 80–95%; Clawesome 95–100%. Higher maturity means a stronger regression
> expectation.
