## Candidate

## Test first

[Release notes]({{RELEASE_NOTES_URL}})

Themes summarize the complete release notes; linked issues are representative
examples.

{{RELEASE_PRIORITIES}}

## How to use this worksheet

Start with the priorities above or choose any subsystem you know well. Add notes
directly beneath that subsystem's heading; an empty or comment-only section
means you did not test it. Record failures, regressions, confusing behavior,
and meaningful latency under **Release findings** as well.

## Release findings

Record candidate OpenClaw problems found during upgrade or testing. For each
finding, note what you expected, what happened, and the affected subsystem.

- None yet.

## Private operator notes

Record OCM, copying, setup, local tooling, and cleanup problems here. This
section is never published to GitHub.

- None yet.
